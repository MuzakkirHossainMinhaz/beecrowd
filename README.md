# Beecrowd Solutions

A collection of solutions to competitive programming problems from [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) online judge.

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to various problems solved on the Beecrowd platform. The solutions are organized by problem number and cover a range of algorithmic challenges and database queries.

## Repository Structure

- Solutions are organized numerically by problem ID
- Primary language: **C++** (`.cpp` files)
- Database problems: **SQL** (`.sql` files)

## Technologies

- **C++** - Algorithmic and data structure problems
- **SQL** - Database query problems

## Usage

These solutions are provided for educational purposes and reference. If you're learning competitive programming, I encourage you to attempt the problems yourself before referring to these solutions.

## Note

This is a personal repository documenting my progress through Beecrowd's problem set. Solutions are continuously updated as new problems are solved.
